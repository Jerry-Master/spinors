# Spinor visualization

Click inside the left sphere to move the flagpole. The corresponding spinor to that rotation appears on the right. You can also move the wheel on the mouse to rotate the flag. 

In following versions I will try to add interactivity to the spinor side too. And make it all less ugly.
